# Useful Datasets

This repository contains lectures on created for the EWU SIAM Student Chapter on Python for Data Science. These lectures contain code that demonstrates cleaning data using pandas, data mining, and the modeling of data using Scikit Learn. I have also provided a list of links to data repositories ranging in complexity (from clean to raw datasets).
